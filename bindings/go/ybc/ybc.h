 * Cache cluster API.
 *
 * Shards requests among available caches proportional to their max_items_count
 * values. Multiple caches can be useful in the following cases:
 * - As a workaround for filesystem limit on maximum file size.
 * - For speeding up I/O-bound cache requests if distinct caches are placed onto
 *   distinct physical devices. Requests can become I/O-bound only if frequently
 *   accessed items don't fit available physical RAM (in other words, program's
 *   working set doesn't fit physical RAM). If program's working set is smaller
 *   than RAM, then there is no any sense in splitting the cache into distinct
 *   shards irregardless of the total cache size (it may be 1000x larger
 *   than physical RAM size, but it should contain 99.9% of rarely accessed
 *   items - aka 'cold items').
 *
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * // Initialize configs
 * const size_t caches_count = 2;
 * char configs_buf[ybc_config_get_size() * caches_count];
 * struct ybc_config *const configs = (struct ybc_config *)configs_buf;
 * struct ybc_config *config;
 *
 * config = YBC_CONFIG_GET(configs, 0);
 * ybc_config_init(config);
 * ybc_config_set_max_items_count(config, 100 * 1000 * 1000);
 * ybc_config_set_data_file_size(config, (size_t)128 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);
 * ybc_config_set_index_file(config, "/hdd0/cache.index");
 * ybc_config_set_data_file(config, "/ssd0/cache.data");
 *
 * config = YBC_CONFIG_GET(configs, 1);
 * ybc_config_init(config);
 * ybc_config_set_max_items_count(config, 200 * 1000 * 1000);
 * ybc_config_set_data_file_size(config, (size_t)256 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);
 * ybc_config_set_index_file(config, "/hdd1/cache.index");
 * ybc_config_set_data_file(config, "/ssd1/cache.data");
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Open cache cluster
 * char ybc_cluster_buf[ybc_cluster_get_size(caches_count)];
 * struct ybc_cluster *const cluster = (struct ybc_cluster *)ybc_cluster_buf;
 *
 * if (!ybc_cluster_open(cluster, configs, caches_count, 1)) {
 *   log_error("Error when opening cache cluster");
 *   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 * }
 *
 * // Destroy configs, since they are no longer needed.
 * ybc_config_destroy(YBC_CONFIG_GET(configs, 0));
 * ybc_config_destroy(YBC_CONFIG_GET(configs, 1));
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Select appropriate cache for the given key.
 * struct ybc_key key = {
 *     .ptr = key_ptr,
 *     .size = key_size,
 * };
 * char item_buf[ybc_item_get_size()];
 * struct ybc_item *const item = (struct ybc_item *)item_buf;
 * ...
 * struct ybc *const cache = ybc_cluster_get_cache(cluster, &key);
 * ybc_item_get(cache, item, &key);
 * ...
 * ybc_item_release(item);
 * ...
 * ybc_cluster_close(cluster);
