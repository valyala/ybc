Go wrapper around YBC library - see https://github.com/valyala/ybc .

The wrapper has the following features:

  * it is intended for creating extremly fast in-process blob caches,
    which can efficiently cache virtually unlimited number of items.

  * it knows how to deal with huge items (i.e. videos, audios, images)
    and caches exceeding available RAM sizes by multiple orders of magnitude.

  * it supports persistent caches surviving application restarts.

  * it is optimized for both HDDs and SSDs.

  * it is optimized for speed.
